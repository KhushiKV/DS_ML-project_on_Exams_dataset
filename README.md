# DS_ML-project_on_Exams_dataset

The project explores the field of Data Analysis and training the Decision tree model on our given dataset. 

I completed this project in *a team of three members*: Yarthem Muivah, Hardik Madnani, and myself - Khushi Verma. 

In the first part of the project, we got thoroughly in depths with concepts such as using numpy, pandas and python libraries, along with seaborn and matplotlib. We performed **extensive data analysis**. 

The second part of the project deals with **training and testing Decision Tree model** for our dataset. We did so and calculated the accuracy and test scores of our prepared model. Undoubtedly, the project helped us immensely in getting confortable and confident with machine learning, and data science.
